<h1>My Midterm project</h1>
<p>I would like to create a blog website which indicates about cats!<br>
I decided this theme because I really like cats.<br> I grew up with cats when I was in Japan becuase my parents have 6 cats in their house!<br>
In my website, I would like introduce cats items, their life and so on.</p>

<h2>The list I am going to create</h2>
<li><ul>Header</ul></li>
<li><ul>Blog page</ul></li>
<li><ul>Menu</ul></li>

<p>I would like to create at least 3 pages; About, Blog, Shopping and Contact page</p>
<p>This blog website would have a role of charity, so I would like to add a shoppping page which sales cat items.</p>
