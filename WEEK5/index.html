<!--Background paragraph-->
        <h2 id="What">What did I do in Japan?</h2>
        <p>Prior to at FIT, I worked in the Japanese fashion industry for six years.<br>
        Throughout each project, I contributed to an increase in sales for my assigned brands <br>and was able to develop my skills in graphic, print, and digital design.<br>From these experience, I realized that web design is the most important for each project.<br> Therefore, I decided to study web design and coding.</p>

<!--About last semester-->
        <h2 id="Why">Why is coding important for me?</h2>
        <p>Last semester, I took the coding class at Parsons, but the class was not nice <br>because my professer has never answered students' questions. So, I have studied coding <b>by myself.</b><br>
        Self studing was a little bit hard, but I was happy when I succeeded to create <a href="http://b.parsons.edu/~naruk265/parsons/final/mochi_mochi.html">a website.</a><br>
        Now, I really like coding and I would like to learn about <i>HTML</i> and<i> CSS</i> more and more before I study about <i>JavaScript.</i></p>

<!--Info about Brackets and extension-->
        <h2 id="text">About text editors</h2>
        <p>I usually use <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> and<a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/"> Sublime text</a> . But I noticed  <a href="http://brackets.io">Brackets</a> is also useful. I was really surprised that we can<br> see<i>"Live Preview"</i> easily if we would use it. I like this function.<br>
        I also like the extension named <a href="http://emmet.io">Emmet</a>. I appreciate to know this, because we can resuce the time to code if<br> we would use it. I would like to download it and use it from now on.</p>
