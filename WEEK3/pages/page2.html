        <h3>About Kobe beef</h3>
        <p>Kobe beef refers to beef from the Tajima strain of Wagyu cattle, raised in<br> Japan's Hyogo Prefecture according to rules as set out by the Kobe Beef<br> Marketing and Distribution Promotion Association. The meat is a delicacy <br>renowned for its flavor, tenderness, and fatty, well-marbled texture. Kobe beef <br>can be prepared as steak, sukiyaki, shabu shabu, sashimi, and teppanyaki.</p>
        <p>I enjoyed to eat Kobe beef when I went back to Japan. If you visit Kobe, I'll take you the best Kobe beef restaurant!</p>
